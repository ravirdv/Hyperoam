Hi all, this is my first attempt at qt programming, HypeRoam is still in its pre-alpha (:P) stage so you may encounter lot of bugs...
and yeah put on your crash helmet before trying it :)
mail me ravirdv [at] gmail [dot] com for any kind of feedback,  feature request or suggestions ;)


PS: you do not need to add "da-iict.org" when adding accounts :)

have fun!
